# A package is a collection of modules and both library and framework are often used interchangeably with packages. 
# Libraries can also be a collection of packages with specific purpose, whereas the term framework 
# is usually used where certain flow and architecture is involved. 



# Data analysis and Data Science popular packages
# Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

# Pandas - Python Data analysis 
# primary for working with datasets, and provides functions for cleaning, analysing and manipulating data

# compare different cols and find arithmetic mean , max and min values.
# primart DS are series and data frames

# Series - Single dimensional and can be compared to a colum in a table
# Data frames- Multi dimensional and can store data tables efficiently

# Most common panda apps
# Reading CSV files, and Json objects

# the library
# import pandas as pd

#Numpy- Numerical python
# scientist use for signal, image, stats and quantum



#Machine Learning and AI
#PyTorch
#TensorFlow


#Web Frame Works
# Fullstack frameworks - Form generations, template layoyts, HTTP request handling, WSGI Interfaces, DB connection handling
# most popular: Django, web2py, pyramid

#Microframeworks - Microframeworks are a lighter version of fullstacks that do not offer as many patterns 
# and functionalities. They are usually used in smaller web projects and building APIs. Flask, Bottle, Dash, 
# and CherryPy are some of the popular microframeworks.

#Asynchronous -types are used to handle a large sets of concurrent connections.
#  They are mainly built using Async IO networking libraries. Growler, AIOHTTP,
#  and Sanic, are some of the names you'll encounter. Choosing a framework can depend on many factors. 

#Django
# Django is a high level framework that encourages clean design and rapid development. It's a full-stack framework that's rich in features and libraries. 
# It's secure and has templating systems and third party supports. 

#Flask - is a microframework and better used for smaller projects. It's easy to learn, simple to use, and as a large library of add-ons.
